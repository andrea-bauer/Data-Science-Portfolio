# Andrea Bauer's Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing data science projects I have completed. Projects are written in R (R Markdown).


# Contents

- ## Machine Learning
     - Classifying Patients with Accute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL): Testing several classification methods (LASSO logistic regression, Support Vector Machine) to predict whether an individual has ALL based on their gene expression profile. Support Vector Machine with linear kernel correctly classified all patients with ALL.
- ## Data Analysis
     - Are Rumble Strips Effective?: Used Poisson regression on PA crash data to determine whether rumble strips are effective in reducing crashes. Results indicate that rumble strips reduce rate of crashes by approximately 20%.
- ## Bayesian Inference
- ## GIS Analysis
